      <description>I recently rewrote the code for this project after moving it to its own github repository.
This started as a project to learn to use d3.js, for which I had to learn to collect the BNF interactions first. But it&amp;rsquo;s useful as a standalone resource you can use to collect your own data - and experiment with visualising it yourself.
Moving it made it easier to review the code I was using, and update any variations (e.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a number of different articles using features from the most recent version of Rstudio Preview.
The benefit of following lots of different Rstats-related people on Twitter means that I a see lot of interesting articles, and there a lot of new features that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in; Python, d3.js, and SQL integration.. But first, one of the articles was about the package Radix.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with it over the weekend to try to store the acedemic projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on as a student, (as well as the eventual DOIs, PMID, journal details that come from them), and move away from the osx notes file I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping so far.</description>

      <description>A while ago I was considering how best to demonstrate the graphics I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing while learning to code. I thought a particular page could provide a useful snapshot of the work I&amp;rsquo;d been interested in, the topics, the media; that I could then build up into a portfolio.
Rather than writing a one-off post however, or something that I&amp;rsquo;d have to edit every 6 months, I wanted a system that I could add to, relatively easily over time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created a tool for searching medical resources, here.

A while ago I was wondering about creating a tool to help me pool together the different resources I use for both revision, and case portfolios for my University work. I tend to do a lot of background research using a small pool of websites that are well-regarded for the fundamentals. SIGN/NICE guidelines, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, the BNF for example.</description>

I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out with my BNF interactions project to see how it might affect the intuitive feel of the graphics.</description>

      <description>Following a very interesting post I&amp;rsquo;d found on twitter by Paul Campbell, I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.
Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.</description>

      <description>function myFunction() { var frames = document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;iframe&#34;); for (i = 0; i  iframe { width:100%; }  Back in February I attended the 19th NHS Hack Day in Cardiff. I had a great experience listening to the pitches, meeting new people involved in healthcare IT, and I joined onto a group looking at self-reported availabilty and capacity statuses for clinics taking NHS 111 referrals.
I was interested in plotting the catchment areas for each type of clinic.</description>

      <description>function myFunction() { var frames = document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;iframe&#34;); for (i = 0; i  iframe { width:100%; }  I’ve been looking back at HTML widgets again this week, having learnt a little more recently about the underline technologies, both D3 and R.
One of these widgets, an R package called ‘ggiraph’, was something I’d used in an earlier post to add interactive features to static ggplots. (Based on openprescribingR data).</description>

      <description>I decided it might be useful to see the interaction information as plain text. Whereas the graph demonstrates the interactions which exist between drugs, as well as conveying the absence of interactions, this can be used as a checklist of warnings in a given drug selection.
 I may add more detail later, such as evidence/severity, and colour coding on severe interactions. But for now it&amp;rsquo;s a list-view of all the interactions known.</description>

      <description>Since my last post I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my original &amp;ldquo;top 100&amp;rdquo; graph, introducing a checkbox for recoloring the paths in red which represent &amp;lsquo;severe&amp;rsquo; interactions.
I&amp;rsquo;m fairly happy with the form of my graph now, although I&amp;rsquo;m still considering the ways I could make it visually informative.
Ideally my intentions were to use hierachical edge bundling as a visual shortcut to allow the viewer to appraise whole drug classes. I.e look at a node on the edge representing a certain drug.</description>

      <title>Drug Interactions with Hierarchical Edge Bundling</title>

      <guid>https://fergustaylor.github.io/post/drug-interactions-with-hierarchical-edge-bundling/</guid>
      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to introduce a hierachical edge bundling method based on an arbitrary list of drug classes. (Adjustable via the tension bar I&amp;rsquo;d previously hidden). I think this makes it far more visually informative now, but I&amp;rsquo;m still playing around with a dev version to consider how I can provide more informational cues to the user.
For now I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a small break to learn some general D3 skills.</description>

      <description>I made a few bits of progress. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lazy to make a &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; tonight.
I&amp;rsquo;ve linked my graph to the interaction messages, severities, evidence gradings taken from bnf.nice.org.uk/interaction/. This reflects the new data being listed by the BNF. It&amp;rsquo;s not always mentioned, many of the drugs have unlabeled evidence or severity values for the interactions.
The &amp;lsquo;severe&amp;rsquo; interactions are highlighted on my sidebar. (As well as severity totals as a whole.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a dendrogram based off the chemical lists provided by NHS digital. (As part of their CCG Spending data).
These lists give a name, and lookup code for every medicine licensed in the UK based on BNF Sections.
E.g Adenosine (Chemical Sub: 0203020C0), i.e BNF &amp;gt; 2. &amp;lsquo;Cardiovascular System&amp;rsquo; &amp;gt; 2.3 &amp;lsquo;Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs&amp;rsquo; &amp;gt; 2.3.2 &amp;lsquo;Drugs for Arrhythmias&amp;rsquo;
This 3-layer dendrogram is composed of every medicine (3292) listed on this look-up for potential NHS spending.</description>

      <description>I eventually learnt how to convert the BNF interactions into a JSON format compatible for the MBostock example of a tensionable hierachical edge bundling diagram.
See the interactive version here.

First every drug, then I reduced it to the 100 most common medications (arbritrarily taken from an article).

See the interactive version here. Whilst the adjacency relationships (drug-drug interaction) work, the drugs aren&amp;rsquo;t grouped by class yet and so increased bundling doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything useful.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while since my last post, and since then I’ve been tinkering at new D3.js examples, and trying to make sense of the respective JS/CSS/HTML DOM components. I’ve found experimented with a few different new environements, including the Google Chrome developer console, but the most intuitive I’ve found has actually been Codepen.
See the dendrograms below. Or interact with them all, here. By pressing left or right.</description>

      <description>I made a few additions to my previous post, after realising I could use the CSS selector to list the interaction information. (I.e if you combine drugs, will it increase the blood concentration of the other? Or reduce it? Or risk a given side-effect, etc..)
I built this into the previous code. (See the full code).
#Interactions interactions &amp;lt;- mapply(url = data, css = drugs_list$css_string, function(url, css){ url %&amp;gt;% html_nodes(css) %&amp;gt;% html_text() }) example_dataframe &amp;lt;- cbind(example_dataframe, data_frame(interactions)) #Rename columns example_dataframe &amp;lt;- example_dataframe %&amp;gt;% rename(Class = &amp;#39;class&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Dangerous Interactions&amp;#39; = &amp;#39;dangerousi&amp;#39;, Interactions = &amp;#39;interactions&amp;#39;) Afterwards I then looked up openprescribing.</description>

      <description>I was thinking about drug interactions the other day: the relevant, and/or dangerous interactions that can occure in patients with multiple comorbidities. And I realised then, how few of these interactions I’d learnt by-heart. If I’d wanted to check, I would have looked up a patient’s drugs up in the BNF individually.
To try to learn them, I want to visualise them - although I’ll likely never learn them all whilst new obscure drugs come out, or drug interactions are discovered over time.</description>

      <description>OpenprescribingR allows you to explore spending and list size data on over 200 different clinical commissioning groups, 9790 prescribing centres, and 23 BNF sections (as well as every invidual drug or presentation).
Updated the old openprescribing graphics, with ggiraph. Then added some for my last post as well.

      <description>This package works by interacting with the openprescribing.net api. Openprescribing.net continues to collate monthly data from NHS digital, which means that you can search the entire dataset without downloading each monthly file. It uses limited search arguments to return data. (This will be updated as the api changes). As such it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to return a desired dataset in some cases by using one function alone in this package. However, it is possible to cross-reference functions in order to return the dataset you&amp;rsquo;d like.</description>

      <description>I wanted to plot some of this new openprescribing data geographically today after playing around with the new functions, however I soon realised I needed locations, and so I converted the &amp;lsquo;CCG boundaries&amp;rsquo; section of the api.
New Function 7. CCG boundaries Search for the boundaries of a CCG, or location of a practice, by code. Returns GeoJSON.
   Output Function     Boundaries of all CCGs CCG_boundaries_or_location()   Boundaries of an individual CCG CCG_boundaries_or_location(CCG_code = &amp;ldquo;99H&amp;rdquo;)   Location (approximate) of practices in a CCG, by code CCG_boundaries_or_location(CCG_code = &amp;ldquo;99H&amp;rdquo;)   Location (approximate) of a practice in a CCG CCG_boundaries_or_location(CCG_code = &amp;ldquo;99H&amp;rdquo;, practice_code = &amp;ldquo;P87003&amp;rdquo;)   Location (approximate) of a practice in a CCG CCG_boundaries_or_location(practice_code = &amp;ldquo;P87003&amp;rdquo;)    Personally I find it very difficult to read JSON files, so you can tidy it up afterwards using JSONlite or tidyjson but I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that to you.</description>

devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;fergustaylor/openprescribingR&amp;quot;)
Load:
library(openprescribingR)
These functions give details on drugs/organisations/list sizes.

      <description>I initially saw the notice of the August update via twitter @PHE_uk, but I later found the full future publication timeline available at gov.uk.
 All their new statistics are summarised in their blog Public Health Matters, and the data is available online with interactive plots through their Fingertips service.
It summarises 33 different National Public Health Profiles, including the most recent version of the Public Health Outcomes Framework.
While I was prepared to download information I wanted directly through the site - I found their fantastic package tool &amp;lsquo;fingertipsR&amp;rsquo; which allows me to import PH data from all profiles directly into the R environment through their API.</description>

Introduction This is an early project based on SIMD data that I&amp;rsquo;m using to try and learn R. I&amp;rsquo;ve used the package &amp;lsquo;ggplot2&amp;rsquo; as part of the Tidyverse to practice a set of skills I&amp;rsquo;m attempting to learn through a combination of DataCamp courses, RStudio &amp;lsquo;Cheat Sheets&amp;rsquo; and twitter.
I thought Arran would make nice maps.
Early progress Initially I used map cordinates given by Ordinance Survey to find the centre of any KA27 postcode on a map.</description>
