<p>A while ago I was considering how best to demonstrate all the graphics I&rsquo;ve produced while learning to code.
I thought a particular page could provide a useful snapshot of the work I&rsquo;d been interested in, the topics, the media; that I could build up into a portfolio.</p>

<p>Rather than writing a one-off post however, or something that I&rsquo;d have to edit every 6 months, I wanted a system that I could add to relatively easily over time.
  I didn&rsquo;t want to add huge numbers of links to an md file, or tags to a html page indefinitely. So I wondered instead if there would be a way to populate a page with graphics from a given folder. Most of the graphics in my posts, I&rsquo;ve saved to a particular <a href="https://fergustaylor.github.io/blogimages *or github page">&rsquo;/blogimages/&rsquo;</a> folder anyway.</p>

<p>I started off with a list of everything I already had, and roughly organised them into different groups that might require different ways to publish.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Blog Graphics
I have a few images (.png) made for particular posts already, and if I could link to them then that might provide an interesting way to interact with the topics covered in my posts.
Also part of this, I had a lot of Gifs.</p></li>

<li><p>Blog Iframes
The same context as above, but including iframes of interesting graphics would require a different approach.</p></li>

<li><p>Twitter posts
I have a few posts with interesting graphics, concise explanations of context, or cool interactions with people working in that field. One of the ways I currently find out about interesting projects, conferences, R packages is Twitter. So I was keen to incorporate it somehow.</p></li>

<li><p>Videos
Something I do the least of, but good to show-off where I already have them.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="blog-graphics">Blog Graphics</h2>

<p>I wrote an .Rmd file, [&lsquo;Portfolio&rsquo;]() with code that collects the names of each file in a folder, and writes a JSON file list of them.
I ended up sorting the graphics into 2 folders, one of the full-size image, one a low-res version for thumbnails.
That way, every time I run my code - it updates a JSON list of graphics to include in the website.</p>

<p>// try to link to code directly?</p>

<pre><code>library(tidyverse)
//rest of code
</code></pre>

<p>I made the gallery post itself as an md file (my website uses Blogdown to convert that into HTML). And I included <a href="https://fergustaylor.github.io/portfolio.js">some javascript,</a> which reads the json file from earlier, and inserts every image inside.</p>

<p>//link directly to code?</p>

<pre><code>d3.json(&quot;../images.json&quot;, function(classes) {
  
for (i = 0; i &lt; classes.length; i++) { 
url1 = &quot;../portfolio/&quot;+classes[i].portfolio;
url2 = &quot;../thumb/&quot;+classes[i].thumb;

url3 = &quot;../portfolio/&quot;+classes[i].portfolio;
url4 = classes[i].portfolio;

example = document.createElement(&quot;article&quot;);
example.className = &quot;work-item&quot;;

example2 = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);
example2.className = &quot;image fit thumb&quot;;
example2.setAttribute(&quot;href&quot;, url1);

example3 = document.createElement(&quot;img&quot;);
example3.setAttribute(&quot;src&quot;, url2);

example4 = document.createElement(&quot;h3&quot;);
example5 = document.createElement(&quot;a&quot;);
example5.setAttribute(&quot;href&quot;, url3);
example5.appendChild(document.createTextNode(url4));
example4.appendChild(example5);

example2.appendChild(example3);
example.appendChild(example2);
example.appendChild(example4);

if(i % 2 == 0)
{
document.getElementById(&quot;twoeven&quot;).appendChild(example);
}
else
{
document.getElementById(&quot;twoodd&quot;).appendChild(example);
}

}
});
</code></pre>

<h2 id="blog-iframes">Blog Iframes</h2>

<p>I then used the same principle as before with a few minor differences, <a href="https://fergustaylor.github.io/portfolio2.js">here</a> to include the list of iframes.
Unfortunately, I have to still make the thumbnails manually.</p>

<h2 id="twitter-posts">Twitter posts</h2>

<p>The twitter posts were interesting. I started with a list of URLS, and since it&rsquo;s relatively easy to embed them individually I did use a fairly similar appraoch to start off with.
However, each tweet took up a lot of unnecessary space, and soon created a long page which was arduous to scroll through.
In addition, in order to include tweets I&rsquo;d then have to add to a long list of URLS. So rather than individually embed them, I thought it&rsquo;d be easier to look at Twitter options.</p>

<p>Twitter allows you to curate lists using Tweetdeck (as well as their own API), which makes it relatively easy to scroll through my timeline.</p>

<p>// screenshot</p>

<p>This updates an embedded grid which I can link to in the gallery md file.
So I can curate the tweets through tweetdeck, and everything else would load up automatically.</p>

<h2 id="videos">Videos</h2>

<p>Then lastly, since I do it so infrequently, videos were just indivudally embedded using [hugo shortcodes]().</p>

<h2 id="last-thoughts">Last thoughts</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with how this turned out. Rather than sorting through all my work I can just add content to a few different folders, and re-run the .rmd.</p>

<p>It still requires I make a low-res version for photos manually, or a screenshot for iframes. And I&rsquo;ll need to look at Tweetdeck every now and then.
But compared to making a portfolio from scratch, I consider this a vast improvement, and something I can add to incrementally over time.</p>
