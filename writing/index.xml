      <description>This was a piece commissioned by the Glasgow Guardian, regarding current negotiations around the second Junior Doctors’ strike. It followed two opinion pieces by other writers earlier that week; putting their arguments both for and against industrial action.
As a student representative (GUSRC), and medical student, I was invited to “consider [writing on the issue] in order to balance this important debate.”
Given the breadth of coverage I felt this had recieved from the previous writers, as well as elsewhere – I pitched a slightly lesser-covered piece of news from earlier that week, that (with the permission of Michael Rosen), I felt helped frame the issue.</description>
