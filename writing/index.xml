      <description>Back in my third year of University I was asked to get involved with the Student Union as an opportunity to improve welfare at the Medical School, in particular - Mental Health.
I had some successes, including the introduction of a new peer support programme. But the issue of advertising the available services so that students were aware of their options when they needed them - has been poorly approached for some time.</description>

      <description>Last year produced several milestones in the development of Glasgow ARM, and with financial charitable recognition came a huge push forward to increase donations.
In order to both thank the Undergraduate Medical School, and highlight the opportunities for further engagement, I wrote the following piece for the 2016 Summer Newsletter.

      <description>Since my second year at medical school I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the formation and running of a charity. Having been preparing to step down in my role as Chair, it fell to me to reach out to new potential trustees within the University-wide newsletter.

      <description>This was a piece commissioned by the Glasgow Guardian, regarding current negotiations around the second Junior Doctors’ strike. It followed two opinion pieces by other writers earlier that week; putting their arguments both for and against industrial action.
As a student representative (GUSRC), and medical student, I was invited to “consider [writing on the issue] in order to balance this important debate.”
Given the breadth of coverage I felt this had recieved from the previous writers, as well as elsewhere – I pitched a slightly lesser-covered piece of news from earlier that week, that (with the permission of Michael Rosen), I felt helped frame the issue.</description>

      <description>Previously made for the Glasgow University Canoe Club - the following satarical short piece was written for the Club journal, as a summary of a Summer trip we spent kayaking around Scotland. Unfortunately, mostly using in-jokes to its members.
Details of incident: After a sunny day kayaking on the Garry - sleepy from an afternoon of BBQ and booty beverages - the kayaking group formally known as GUCC, swam, ferry-glided, or were towed across the river to inspect the rocks beside the final drop.</description>

      <description>By Dr Kenneth Kamler
Recounting his experiences with AMS, surviving adrift at sea, as well as performing hand surgery in the not entirely aseptic depths of the Amazonian Rainforest. Dr Kenneth Kamler tells stories of his adventures and those of his friends, to create a gripping depiction of some of the most inhospitable environments in the world and the conditions that can occur in them.
He details his reactions to the injuries and uses his skills as a storyteller to examine the actions doctors take in order to treat under pressure.</description>
