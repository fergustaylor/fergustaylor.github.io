&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I set off to the Alps for the Conville Mountaineering Course, and learned a few new skills to keep myself safe in the Mountains this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-9.png&#34; class=&#34;image fit&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;*Another group out on Mont Blanc Massif&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the Friday before, where I&amp;rsquo;m desperately trying to sort out my equipment before an early-morning flight to Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-1.png&#34; class=&#34;image left&#34; alt=&#34;*Not pictured: A fresh baguette with brie EVERY day. Or, less importantly, my crampons.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Axe, crampons, harness, HELMET.. that seems important.
Loads of socks, I’m walking after all. Jaffa cakes are vital.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on a crawl around the local mountaineering shops, and already spent a silly amount on extra karabiners and guidebooks.
I think that means I&amp;rsquo;m ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must pack everything I need to travel safely on ice and snow this week.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been awarded a place on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pyb.co.uk/jonathan-conville-memorial-trust/&#34;&gt;Jonathon Conville Alpine Mountaineering Course&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to plan alpine days. I want to know all the essential ropework to travel across glaciers safely, how to rescue someone from a crevasse, and to use axes, crampons as well as different belay systems for navigating treacherous terrain.
So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of equipment I&amp;rsquo;d better bring with me if I&amp;rsquo;m going to be able to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-2.png&#34; class=&#34;image right&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Geneva the next day, and after a brief minibus trip, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to relax in the campsite with a whole baguette and selection of cheeses.
It&amp;rsquo;s carb-loading, probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We meet with our guides the next morning. They&amp;rsquo;re all established guides of Plas y Brenin, with a stunning collective history of mountaineering.
They were full of stories of adventures over the years, making great company on the mountain, and they help the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jcmt.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Jonathon Conville Memorial Trust&lt;/a&gt; achieve its aims to encourage and assist young people to &amp;ldquo;pursue their love of the outdoors in the spirit of adventure&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-4.png&#34; class=&#34;image left&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*My view up the slope to one of the other students, &amp;lsquo;rescuing&amp;rsquo; me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our first day we headed into Chamonix to catch the Montenvers Train up to the Mer de Glace. This is the largest glacier in France, and one of 7 majors which make up the valley.
This was the perfect place then for practicing how to rope up for travel, to rescue someone from a crevasse and to learn how to use crampons and axes together across different terrain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of individual skills being applied here, but the good, clear explanations, together with the repetitive teaching style really drilled the fundamentals again and again throughout the day, and it helped me to learn skills I needed. A lot of what was being applied here is just as useful in Scottish Winter, and many of the places on the course are awarded for just that reason; to help clubs to improve their collective safety back in the UK. This was a fantastic day out on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-13.png&#34; class=&#34;image fit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 and we headed half-way up the Aiguille du Midi. Unfortunately the second stage of the cable car was under repairs, so we walked out onto the Plan de l&amp;rsquo;Aiguille and worked on our systems for climbing together and setting up a belay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-5.png&#34; class=&#34;image left&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set up snow bollards, ice-axe anchors, and learned how to properly place ice scews for belaying or rescuing. It was great to learn this properly from an experienced guide; having someone there to correct, or help improve your attempts.
It was really useful to hear the principles that underlie it, as well as knowing how small differences in the angles or depths could make a huge difference to it failing or not.
Throughout the day you could hear the rocks falling off in the distance as the ice warmed up in the sun, and mini-avalanches going off in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-7.png&#34; class=&#34;image right&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last day, and we drove through the Mont Blanc Tunnel to Italy. Unfortunately since our way up to the Aguille du Midi was closed, we decided to go a little bit further through to the other side of the mountains, and take the cable car to the Punta Helbronner instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up at height, we were able to put to use all the skills that we&amp;rsquo;d been learning that week. We split up into pairs to travel across the glacier, then up a ridge to ascend the Aiguille d&amp;rsquo;Entrèves.
After a few photos and snacks, we followed our footsteps back across the glacier, and up the Aiguille de Toula.
These were 2 easy routes that helped us to practice our safety systems, climbing together, and just get a feel for how things run on an alpine day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-10.png&#34; class=&#34;image left&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After regrouping back at the cable station, the end of our course was a long conversation about what came next for us.
We talked about gradings, how to plan out a route, as well as a few example days we should be trying out; the next steps for us individually. It was incredibly inspiring to hear this, and really took out a lot of the fear and hesitations about overreaching your own capabilities in mountaineering. Contextualising that difficulty and risk, especially in terms of our own experiences gave us a lot of opportunity to go off and advance our own skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming away from the course I felt far more capable in myself, and in my capacity to plan out for the next set of adventures.
I&amp;rsquo;d recommend the course to anyone looking to live life more adventurously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../writing/chamonix-14.png&#34; class=&#34;image fit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few tips for next time;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chamonix.com/office-de-haute-montagne,48-492959,en.html&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Maison de la Montagne&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; is a treasure trove of information if you need to look at a guidebook, see a map, or ask any questions when planning a day out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now get cheap, external batteries powerful enough to charge your phone for a week. Great for travelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lifts, (and huts), open properly from mid-June. Worth looking up the dates when planning your trip, as not all of them will be open at the start of the season. Many of the routes will require a long walk-in otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chamonix.com/camping-glacier-d-argentiere,117-209504,en.html&#34;&gt;Camping D&amp;rsquo;Argentiere&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to stay if you&amp;rsquo;re on the course, or even just climbing in the valley during the Summer. It&amp;rsquo;s very social, and a great place to find climbing partners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This course was part-funded by Go Ape. I recieved funding through their staff &lt;a href=&#34;https://goape.co.uk/blog&#34;&gt;Adventure Fund.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&#39;You alright?&#39;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in my third year of University I was asked to get involved with the Student Union as an opportunity to improve welfare at the Medical School, in particular - Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some successes, including the introduction of a new &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/glasmedpeersupport/&#34;&gt;peer support programme&lt;/a&gt;. But the issue of advertising the available services so that students were aware of their options when they needed them - has been poorly approached for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a whim, I wrote the following posters one evening.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../header/img_1355.jpg&#34;          width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a little work. I made the following, later endorsed by the med school.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;../header/how-are-you-feeling.png&#34;          width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Glasgow ARM - Supporting Rwandan Healthcare Students</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last year produced several milestones in the development of Glasgow ARM, and with financial charitable recognition came a huge push forward to increase donations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to both thank the Undergraduate Medical School, and highlight the opportunities for further engagement, I wrote the following piece for the 2016 Summer Newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://us10.campaign-archive2.com/?u=fb47cc0037f082870347d2bb5&amp;amp;id=61d73f7f3c&amp;amp;e=%5bUNIQID%5d&#34;&gt;The article in context.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my second year at medical school I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in the formation and running of a charity. Having been preparing to step down in my role as Chair, it fell to me to reach out to new potential trustees within the University-wide newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a piece commissioned by the Glasgow Guardian, regarding current negotiations around the second Junior Doctors’ strike. It followed two opinion pieces by other writers earlier that week; putting their arguments both for and against industrial action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a student representative (GUSRC), and medical student, I was invited to “consider [writing on the issue] in order to balance this important debate.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the breadth of coverage I felt this had recieved from the previous writers, as well as elsewhere – I pitched a slightly lesser-covered piece of news from earlier that week, that (with the permission of Michael Rosen), I felt helped frame the issue..&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accident Incident Report: 18/06/14</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously made for the Glasgow University Canoe Club - the following satarical short piece was written for the Club journal, as a summary of a Summer trip we spent kayaking around Scotland. Unfortunately, mostly using in-jokes to its members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of incident: After a sunny day kayaking on the Garry - sleepy from an afternoon of BBQ and booty beverages - the kayaking group formally known as GUCC, swam, ferry-glided, or were towed across the river to inspect the rocks beside the final drop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having surveyed from the rocks, Kayaking President Elderflower reasoned that jumping into the whirling, mass of white water would push the jumper down into the rocky depths for a really long time. Lord President River graded the water as “super gnarly” and “definitely not drowny”, finally adding “who’s in?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following brief discussion, Kate ‘insert-generic-comment-on-Canada’ Whitaker, reasoned that taking off our BAs would allow the jumper to sink deeper into the murky, airless depths. Some consideration was made as to taking off their helmets for better water-dynamics, but on balance, the group decided that the extra weight of the helmet would allow the swimmer to sink deeper – a compromise in the absence of weighted boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly before being pulled down river, Cat Mc-[CheapJoke] could be heard shouting “jump in guys, the water’s lovely” also “Argh, save me! Blughhg &lt;em&gt;glug&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;glug&lt;/em&gt; *bubble bubble*” before falling off the rapids below. The rest of the group soon followed to cries of “Whoo!”, “Arhg”, and a hopeful, “I hope someone took pictures!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caused the event (describe fully): Hubris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the consequence of the event (describe fully): Everyone looked especially cool; some sweet videos may be found on the Facebook profiles of the deceased for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional Comments: Paramedics on the scene remarked that the jump looked “totally sweet” and “definitely worth a go once we dump these [mottled, water-bloated corpses]”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Extreme Survival: A Doctor Explores the Limits of Human Endurance</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By Dr Kenneth Kamler&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recounting his experiences with AMS, surviving adrift at sea, as well as performing hand surgery in the not entirely aseptic depths of the Amazonian Rainforest. Dr Kenneth Kamler tells stories of his adventures and those of his friends, to create a gripping depiction of some of the most inhospitable environments in the world and the conditions that can occur in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He details his reactions to the injuries and uses his skills as a storyteller to examine the actions doctors take in order to treat under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impact that doctors’ actions can have on a group’s survival is significant, and he raises difficult questions about the right thing to do when a whole team’s lives are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writer has travelled across the Antarctic, Amazon, and worked on several high altitude projects with the New York Explorers Society, NASA, DARPA, and MIT. From these he selects anecdotes to demonstrate the difficulties of long-expeditions, the limits of human endurance, and the terrible complications that can arise from even routine conditions – far away from specialised medical intervention and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Dr Kamler’s notions on human survival seem to stretch the available facts at times; the stories they are based on are fascinating. To anyone with an interest in expedition medicine or the outdoors; this book leaves you with both a sense of wanderlust and adventure.
An exceptional read.&lt;/p&gt;
