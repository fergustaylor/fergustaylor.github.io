      <description>I was thinking about drug interactions the other day: the relevant, and/or dangerous interactions that can occure in patients with multiple comorbidities. And I realised then, how few of these interactions I’d learnt by-heart. If I’d wanted to check, I would have looked up a patient’s drugs up in the BNF individually.
To try to learn them, I want to visualise them - although I’ll likely never learn them all whilst new obscure drugs come out, or drug interactions are discovered over time.</description>
