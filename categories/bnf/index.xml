      <title>Drug Interactions with Hierarchical Edge Bundling</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve finally managed to introduce a hierachical edge bundling method based on an arbitrary list of drug classes. (Adjustable via the tension bar I&amp;rsquo;d previously hidden). I think this makes it far more visually informative now, but I&amp;rsquo;m still playing around with a dev version to consider how I can provide more informational cues to the user.
For now I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a small break to learn some general D3 skills.</description>

      <title>BNF Interactions</title>

      <description>I made a few bits of progress.
Here.
I&amp;rsquo;m a bit lazy to make a &amp;lsquo;how-to&amp;rsquo; tonight.
But in summary - I&amp;rsquo;ve linked my graph to the interaction messages, severities, evidence gradings taken from bnf.nice.org.uk/interaction/. This reflects the new data being listed by the BNF.
The &amp;lsquo;severe&amp;rsquo; interactions are highlighted on my sidebar. (As well as severity totals as a whole.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve also made an on:hover comparison tool, for the drug selected and any other.</description>

      <title>All The Medicine</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a dendrogram based off the chemical lists provided by NHS digital. (As part of their CCG Spending data).
These lists give a name, and lookup code for every medicine licensed in the UK based on BNF Sections.
E.g Adenosine (Chemical Sub: 0203020C0), i.e BNF &amp;gt; 2. &amp;lsquo;Cardiovascular System&amp;rsquo; &amp;gt; 2.3 &amp;lsquo;Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs&amp;rsquo; &amp;gt; 2.3.2 &amp;lsquo;Drugs for Arrhythmias&amp;rsquo;
This 3-layer dendrogram is composed of every medicine (3292) listed on this look-up for potential NHS spending.</description>

      <description>I eventually learnt how to convert the BNF interactions into a JSON format compatible for the MBostock example of a tensionable hierachical edge bundling diagram.
See the interactive version here.

First every drug, then I reduced it to the 100 most common medications (arbritrarily taken from an article).

See the interactive version here. Whilst the adjacency relationships (drug-drug interaction) work, the drugs aren&amp;rsquo;t grouped by class yet and so increased bundling doesn&amp;rsquo;t reveal anything useful.</description>

      <title>BNF Sections Visualised</title>

      <description>It’s been a while since my last post, and since then I’ve been tinkering at new D3.js examples, and trying to make sense of the respective JS/CSS/HTML DOM components. I’ve found experimented with a few different new environements, including the Google Chrome developer console, but the most intuitive I’ve found has actually been Codepen.
See the dendrograms below. Or interact with them all, here. By pressing left or right.</description>

      <description>I finally made some sankey diagrams using an R import for the D3 graph. I’ll write the methodology up in a separate post once I can create something a bit more visualy informative.

      <title>Interactions Continued</title>

      <description>I made a few additions to my previous post, after realising I could use the CSS selector to list the interaction information. (I.e if you combine drugs, will it increase the blood concentration of the other? Or reduce it? Or risk a given side-effect, etc..)
I built this into the previous code. (See the full code).
#Interactions interactions &amp;lt;- mapply(url = data, css = drugs_list$css_string, function(url, css){ url %&amp;gt;% html_nodes(css) %&amp;gt;% html_text() }) example_dataframe &amp;lt;- cbind(example_dataframe, data_frame(interactions)) #Rename columns example_dataframe &amp;lt;- example_dataframe %&amp;gt;% rename(Class = &amp;#39;class&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Dangerous Interactions&amp;#39; = &amp;#39;dangerousi&amp;#39;, Interactions = &amp;#39;interactions&amp;#39;) Afterwards I then looked up openprescribing.</description>

      <description>I was thinking about drug interactions the other day: the relevant, and/or dangerous interactions that can occure in patients with multiple comorbidities. And I realised then, how few of these interactions I’d learnt by-heart. If I’d wanted to check, I would have looked up a patient’s drugs up in the BNF individually.
To try to learn them, I want to visualise them - although I’ll likely never learn them all whilst new obscure drugs come out, or drug interactions are discovered over time.</description>
