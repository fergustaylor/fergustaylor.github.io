      <description>I was thinking about drug interactions the other day; as I listened to a conversation between 2 doctors on the relevant, and/or dangerous interactions that could have occured in a patient with multiple comorbidities. And I realised then, how few of these interactions I’d learnt by-heart yet then. Rather, if I’d wanted to check, I would have looked the patient’s drugs up in the BNF individually. I thought then that I should try to plot them, in the spirit of trying to understand them all, (which I’ll likely never do as new, obscure drugs come out, or as drug interactions are discovered over time).</description>
