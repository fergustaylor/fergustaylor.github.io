      <description>I initially saw the notice of the August update via twitter @PHE_uk, but I later found the full future publication timeline available at gov.uk.
 All their new statistics are summarised in their blog Public Health Matters, and the data is available online with interactive plots through their Fingertips service.
It summarises 33 different National Public Health Profiles, including the most recent version of the Public Health Outcomes Framework.
While I was prepared to download information I wanted directly through the site - I found their fantastic package tool &amp;lsquo;fingertipsR&amp;rsquo; which allows me to import PH data from all profiles directly into the R environment through their API.</description>
