      <title>Rstudio Preview - Radix</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a number of different articles using features from the most recent version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/&#34;&gt;Rstudio Preview.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of following lots of different Rstats-related people on Twitter means that I a see lot of interesting articles, and there a lot of new features that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in; Python, d3.js, and SQL integration.. But first, one of the articles was about the package &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/radix/&#34;&gt;Radix.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with it over the weekend to try to store the acedemic projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on as a student, (as well as the eventual DOIs, PMID, journal details that come from them), and move away from the osx notes file I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping so far.
There were a few teething problems rendering the XML files, but overall I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed.
My hope would be that this would become something I could refer to and use in an interview setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the results &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/academic/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Custom Search</title>
      <link>https://fergustaylor.github.io/post/google-custom-search/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created a tool for searching medical resources, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Search/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:62.5% 0 0 0;position:relative;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/276458805?loop=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&#34; style=&#34;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I was wondering about creating a tool to help me pool together the different resources I use for both revision, and case portfolios for my University work.
I tend to do a lot of background research using a small pool of websites that are well-regarded for the fundamentals. SIGN/NICE guidelines, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, the BNF for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of overlap between them, and as such, when I&amp;rsquo;m looking up information on something I&amp;rsquo;ll tend to search for the same thing on each site individually, then compare what I could find between them.
This sort of work, as it turns out is perfect for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cse.google.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Google Custom Search&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to create search bars on particular sites.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a seach bar based on the websites I&amp;rsquo;d check, with &amp;lsquo;refinements&amp;rsquo; used to group individual site results into tabs.
This means I can submit a particular search request, then flick through the sites individually to see what they cover. An unexpected benefit of this is the specificity of the autosuggest that comes from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hosted without sidebar &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Search/example.html&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some further room for customisation, for example it has google images options, which I may specify for for Radiopaedia.
I may end up changing the sites it uses over time, but I think for a particular set of repetitive tasks like researching case portfolios, this will be useful enough over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the ads are a little intrusive, however Google CSE does offer some option to remove them for charitable projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part of it ending up being the dynamic iframe to put it in.
(Given that autosuggest changes the necessary height.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;border-bottom:1px solid #e1e8ed;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built this under a new repository, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Dev&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; for each of the smaller bits and pieces that don&amp;rsquo;t quite warrant their own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UK Local Elections 2017</title>
      <link>https://fergustaylor.github.io/post/uk-local-elections-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://fergustaylor.github.io/post/uk-local-elections-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a very interesting post I&amp;rsquo;d found on twitter by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/05/02/2018-04-08-multivariate-dot-density-maps-in-r-with-sf-ggplot2/&#34;&gt;Paul Campbell,&lt;/a&gt; I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../blogimages/party_points.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did wonder if the sense of geographic detail from each plot point, (the location within a ward is randomly generated), was misleading though.
For example, 100 plots below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Local%20Elections/party.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the variation between each frame, however I was surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice more of a difference.
Perhaps just due to the scale of the individual points to the electoral ward it retained the same sense of voting proportions, as well as (although to a lesser-extent) geographic spread across parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting plot to try out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying &amp;lsquo;Guardian Visual&amp;rsquo; and other election coverage recently, especially in the run-up to this year&amp;rsquo;s local elections, and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
