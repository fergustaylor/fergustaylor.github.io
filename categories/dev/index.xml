      <description>Edit 21/06/2019: Radix has since been renamed Distill and I&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten academic to use the new package.
I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a number of different articles using features from the most recent version of Rstudio Preview.
The benefit of following lots of different Rstats-related people on Twitter means that I a see lot of interesting articles, and there a lot of new features that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in; Python, d3.js, and SQL integration.</description>

      <description>Earlier this September I started my final year of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. Not wanting to be too out-of-date before returing to the wards, I looked back over a course resource summarising the 50 most commmonly used drugs on the ward.
This is an interesting project created by SSC students at my University. &amp;hellip;, with &amp;hellip;. Unfortunately, the resource itself isn&amp;rsquo;t prepared in an ideal way to revise from.</description>

      <description>In my medical degree I was recently on placement at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Accident and Emergency department. While there, I assisted with an audit into early pregnancy presentations to the department over a monthly period.
The point of this was to consider the presentation of patients to the department, and whether or not discharge criteria could be considered at triage in the form of a pro-forma, as is already the case in other Glasgow A and E departments.</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a lot on a couple of different projects that have used interesting combinations of ggplot.
I&amp;rsquo;ll write some of these up properly when I get the chance, but for now, some interesting examples.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created a tool for searching medical resources, here.

A while ago I was wondering about creating a tool to help me pool together the different resources I use for both revision, and case portfolios for my University work. I tend to do a lot of background research using a small pool of websites that are well-regarded for the fundamentals. SIGN/NICE guidelines, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, the BNF for example.</description>

      <title>UK Local Elections 2017</title>

      <description>Following a very interesting post I&amp;rsquo;d found on twitter by Paul Campbell, I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.
Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.</description>
