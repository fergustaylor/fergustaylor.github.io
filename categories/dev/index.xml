      <title>Rstudio Preview - Radix</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read a number of different articles using features from the most recent version of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/&#34;&gt;Rstudio Preview.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of following lots of different Rstats-related people on Twitter means that I a see lot of interesting articles, and there a lot of new features that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in; Python, d3.js, and SQL integration.. But first, one of the articles was about the package &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/radix/&#34;&gt;Radix.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with it over the weekend to try to store the acedemic projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on as a student, (as well as the eventual DOIs, PMID, journal details that come from them), and move away from the osx notes file I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping so far.
There were a few teething problems rendering the XML files, but overall I&amp;rsquo;m really impressed.
My hope would be that this would become something I could refer to and use in an interview setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the results &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/academic/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>50 Drugs</title>
      <link>/post/50-drugs/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/50-drugs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this September I started my final year of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. Not wanting to be too out-of-date before returing to the wards, I looked back over a course resource summarising the 50 most commmonly used drugs on the ward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting project created by SSC students at my University. &amp;hellip;, with &amp;hellip;. Unfortunately, the resource itself isn&amp;rsquo;t prepared in an ideal way to revise from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wondered instead if there might be a better way to create an interface for it, similar to how I had presented the &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/bnf-interactions/&#34;&gt;BNF project.&lt;/a&gt;
This is an active project with ongoing work, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/categories/bnf/&#34;&gt;described here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This presented me with an interesting project and a series of main problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all;
1. getting the data
The data itself is a course resource, kept in our course materials/lecture repository Moodle.
This requires me to log-in to see, making it a more complicated webscrape session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;formatting it
The data then has to be processed in an R session to produce something I can use online.
(I.e a JSON format).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;creating a useful interface for presenting the data
Then the part I wanted to revise from. I wanted a simple user interface that could present multiple drugs at a time.
I wanted something searchable that I could create custom selections with - at least to the level of organisation already applied to that dataset, (general drug classes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to use the Rscraping tool Rvest, modified to download through the log-in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;///
As you can see, the original interface is quite messy. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of unnecessary information listed.
You can&amp;rsquo;t tell from photos, but switching between tabs causes the entire page to reload, and you have to scroll through all the unnecessary information to get back to the important bits.
Not a huge problem, but all of it adds unnecessary delays which makes the whole experience unwieldy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see my work, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/50%20Drugs/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Audit</title>

      <guid>/post/audit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my medical degree I was recently on placement at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Accident and Emergency department.
While there, I assisted with an audit into early pregnancy presentations to the department over a monthly period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this was to consider the presentation of patients to the department, and whether or not discharge criteria could be considered at triage in the form of a pro-forma, as is already the case in other Glasgow A and E departments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been working a lot on a couple of different projects that have used interesting combinations of ggplot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll write some of these up properly when I get the chance, but for now, some interesting examples.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Custom Search</title>
      <link>/post/google-custom-search/</link>

      <guid>/post/google-custom-search/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve created a tool for searching medical resources, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Search/&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;padding:62.5% 0 0 0;position:relative;&#34;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/276458805?loop=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&#34; style=&#34;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A while ago I was wondering about creating a tool to help me pool together the different resources I use for both revision, and case portfolios for my University work.
I tend to do a lot of background research using a small pool of websites that are well-regarded for the fundamentals. SIGN/NICE guidelines, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, the BNF for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a bit of overlap between them, and as such, when I&amp;rsquo;m looking up information on something I&amp;rsquo;ll tend to search for the same thing on each site individually, then compare what I could find between them.
This sort of work, as it turns out is perfect for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cse.google.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Google Custom Search&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to create search bars on particular sites.
I&amp;rsquo;ve created a seach bar based on the websites I&amp;rsquo;d check, with &amp;lsquo;refinements&amp;rsquo; used to group individual site results into tabs.
This means I can submit a particular search request, then flick through the sites individually to see what they cover. An unexpected benefit of this is the specificity of the autosuggest that comes from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hosted without sidebar &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Search/example.html&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some further room for customisation, for example it has google images options, which I may specify for for Radiopaedia.
I may end up changing the sites it uses over time, but I think for a particular set of repetitive tasks like researching case portfolios, this will be useful enough over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the ads are a little intrusive, however Google CSE does offer some option to remove them for charitable projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most difficult part of it ending up being the dynamic iframe to put it in.
(Given that autosuggest changes the necessary height.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;border-bottom:1px solid #e1e8ed;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built this under a new repository, &lt;a href=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;Dev&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; for each of the smaller bits and pieces that don&amp;rsquo;t quite warrant their own.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>UK Local Elections 2017</title>
      <link>/post/uk-local-elections-2017/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/uk-local-elections-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a very interesting post I&amp;rsquo;d found on twitter by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/05/02/2018-04-08-multivariate-dot-density-maps-in-r-with-sf-ggplot2/&#34;&gt;Paul Campbell,&lt;/a&gt; I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../blogimages/party_points.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did wonder if the sense of geographic detail from each plot point, (the location within a ward is randomly generated), was misleading though.
For example, 100 plots below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://fergustaylor.github.io/Dev/Local%20Elections/party.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;width:100%;height:auto;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see the variation between each frame, however I was surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice more of a difference.
Perhaps just due to the scale of the individual points to the electoral ward it retained the same sense of voting proportions, as well as (although to a lesser-extent) geographic spread across parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was an interesting plot to try out. I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying &amp;lsquo;Guardian Visual&amp;rsquo; and other election coverage recently, especially in the run-up to this year&amp;rsquo;s local elections, and it&amp;rsquo;s given me a lot to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
