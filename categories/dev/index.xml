      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve created a tool for searching medical resources, here.
 A while ago I was wondering about creating a tool to help me pool together the different resources I use for both revision, and case portfolios for my University work. I tend to do a lot of background research using a small pool of websites that are well-regarded for the fundamentals. SIGN/NICE guidelines, Clinical Knowledge Summaries, the BNF for example.</description>

      <description>Following a very interesting post I&amp;rsquo;d found on twitter by Paul Campbell, I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.
Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.</description>
