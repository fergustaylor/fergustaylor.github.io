      <description>I’m a Glasgow medical student with interests in Global Surgery, C8H10N4O2, and skyscanner.
I’m interested in academic medicine, and have worked on a few research projects as a student. I’m currently learning how to use more data science tools with R. (As well as a little Python and HTML, mostly for my Pi).
Eventually I’ll learn to become proficient in SQL.
I tend to use private repositories on Github when I’m working, and make them public once I’ve cleaned up the code - especially when I’m using public datasets.</description>
