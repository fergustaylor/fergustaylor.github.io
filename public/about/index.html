<p>About Me: I’m a Glasgow medical student with interests in Global Surgery, C8H10N4O2, and skyscanner.</p>
<p>I’m interested in academic medicine, and have worked on a few research projects as a student. I’m currently learning how to use more data science tools with R. (As well as a little Python and HTML, mostly for the Pi).</p>
<p>Eventually I’ll try to become proficient in SQL.</p>
<p>I tend to use private repositories on Github when I’m working, and make them public once I’ve cleaned up the code - especially when I’m using public datasets. So if there’s something I can share while I’m going along, I do at least try to post explanations of what I’m working on here.</p>
<p>All the code should be reproduceable from github and the data sources marked out in my scripts. These projects show some examples of work I’m interested in at the moment.</p>
