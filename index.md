**About Me:** I'm a Glasgow medical student with interests in Global Surgery, C8H10N4O2, and skyscanner. 

I've an interest in academic medicine, and have worked on a few projects as a student.
I'm currently learning how to do more data science using R. (As well as a little Python and HTML, mostly for the Pi).

Eventually I'll try to become proficient in SQL. 

I tend to use private repositories on Github when I'm working, and make them public once I've cleaned up the code - especially when I'm using public datasets. So if there's something I can share while I'm going along, I do at least try to post explanations of what I'm working on here.

All the code should be reproduceable from github and the data sources marked out in my scripts.
These projects show some examples of work I'm interested in at the moment.
