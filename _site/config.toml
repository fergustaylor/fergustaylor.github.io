		content = "[**About Me:**](./about) I’m a Glasgow medical student with a passion for Global Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery. From August 2019 I'll be working as an Academic Foundation Doctor in Dundee. <br><br>I'm interested in quality improvement in healthcare, and I’ve worked on a few research projects as a student. I’m currently learning how to use more data science tools with R. (.. d3.js and HTML).<br><br>Next I’ll work on LaTex, Python and SQL.<br><br>I tend to use private repositories on Github when I’m working, and make them public once I’ve cleaned up the code - especially when I’m using public datasets. But if there’s something I can share here while I’m going along, I do at least try to post explanations of what I’m working.<br><br>All the code should be reproducible from Github and the data sources marked out in my scripts. These projects show some examples of work I’m interested in at the moment."
