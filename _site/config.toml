I’m currently learning how to use more data science tools with R. (As well as a little Python and HTML, mostly for the Pi).<br><br>Eventually I’ll try to become proficient in SQL.<br><br>I tend to use private repositories on Github when I’m working, and make them public once I’ve cleaned up the code - especially when I’m using public datasets. So if there’s something I can share while I’m going along, I do at least try to post explanations of what I’m working on here.<br><br>All the code should be reproduceable from github and the data sources marked out in my scripts. These projects show some examples of work I’m interested in at the moment."
