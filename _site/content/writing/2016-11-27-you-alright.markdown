Back in my third year of University I was asked to get involved with the Student Union as an opportunity to improve welfare at the Medical School, in particular - Mental Health.

I had some successes, including the introduction of a new [peer support programme](http://www.facebook.com/glasmedpeersupport/). But the issue of advertising the available services so that students were aware of their options when they needed them - has been poorly approached for some time.

On a whim, I wrote the following posters one evening.

With a little work. I made the following, later endorsed by the med school.
