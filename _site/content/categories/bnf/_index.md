A project mapping drug interactions listed in the BNF. Working with hierachical edge bundling algorithms.

This was started in the repository [D3](https://github.com/fergustaylor/D3), which I also use for other d3.js examples.
But information on collecting BNF data, as well as an updated graphic has now been moved to [bnf-interactions.](https://github.com/fergustaylor/bnf-interactions)
