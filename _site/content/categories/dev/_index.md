This is 'Dev', a Github repository for all the smaller projects I'm working on.<br>
Searchable clinical knowledge summaries, visualising local election results or the Humanitarian Data Exchange.. Even just interesting plots.<br>
Not all of it is complete, but it's a good place to keep everything else.
