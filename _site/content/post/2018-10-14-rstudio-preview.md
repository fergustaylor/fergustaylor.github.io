I've recently read a number of different articles using features from the most recent version of [Rstudio Preview.](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/)

The benefit of following lots of different Rstats-related people on Twitter means that I a see lot of interesting articles, and there a lot of new features that I'm interested in; Python, d3.js, and SQL integration.. But first, one of the articles was about the package [Radix.](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/)

I've been experimenting with it over the weekend to try to store the acedemic projects I've worked on as a student, (as well as the eventual DOIs, PMID, journal details that come from them), and move away from the osx notes file I've been keeping so far.
There were a few teething problems rendering the XML files, but overall I'm really impressed.
My hope would be that this would become something I could refer to and use in an interview setting.

You can see the results [here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/academic/)
