A while ago I was considering how to demonstrate a snapshot of all the graphics I've produced while learning to code.

https://fergustaylor.github.io/gallery/

Twitter

Blog Graphics

Blog Iframes

Videos

The problem I had was publishing a large number of graphics, then maintaining references to them over time.
I didn't really want to indefinitely add huge numbers of links to an md file, or tags to a html page.

So I wondered instead if there were a way to populate a page with graphics in a given folder.
Most of the graphics I use anyway, I've saved to a particular '/blogimages/' directory on the website repository.

I started off with a notes file list of all the images/iframes/tweets/links I wanted to include.

I then saved the images to a new folder, 'portfolio'.
And saved low-res versions to a new folder, 'thumb'.

I wrote a .Rmd file, 'Portfolio' with R code that collects the names of each file in those folders, and writes a JSON file listing them (both high and low-res).
That way, every time I run it - it updates a list of graphics to include in the website. 

```
library(tidyverse)
...
```

I made the gallery post itself as an md file (my website uses Blogdown). It includes some javascript, [here](https://fergustaylor.github.io/portfolio.js) which reads the json file, and includes every image inside. 

```
d3.json("../images.json", function(classes) {
  
for (i = 0; i < classes.length; i++) { 
url1 = "../portfolio/"+classes[i].portfolio;
url2 = "../thumb/"+classes[i].thumb;

url3 = "../portfolio/"+classes[i].portfolio;
url4 = classes[i].portfolio;

example = document.createElement("article");
example.className = "work-item";

example2 = document.createElement("a");
example2.className = "image fit thumb";
example2.setAttribute("href", url1);

example3 = document.createElement("img");
example3.setAttribute("src", url2);

example4 = document.createElement("h3");
example5 = document.createElement("a");
example5.setAttribute("href", url3);
example5.appendChild(document.createTextNode(url4));
example4.appendChild(example5);

example2.appendChild(example3);
example.appendChild(example2);
example.appendChild(example4);

if(i % 2 == 0)
{
document.getElementById("twoeven").appendChild(example);
}
else
{
document.getElementById("twoodd").appendChild(example);
}

}
});
```

I used the same principles with a few minor differences, [here](https://fergustaylor.github.io/portfolio2.js) to include iframes.
The iframe sources are html files, (graphics that are exported as .html), kept in a seperate 'iframes' folder, which is listed in the same way as the images are. The thumbnails are kept seperately, made manually.

The third group of content I wanted to include were tweets. I've published a few graphics few twitter which are interesting in-context.
Rather than individually embed them from a list, I thought it'd be easier to look at Twitter options.
Twitter allows you to curate lists using Tweetdeck (as well as their own API), and you can create an embedded grid of them to put in the gallery md file.
All of that meant I could curate the tweets through tweetdeck, and everything else would load up automatically.
```

Then last, something I do least frequently, videos were indivudally embedded using hugo shortcodes.
