So I've finally managed to introduce a hierachical edge bundling method based on an arbitrary list of drug classes. (Adjustable via the tension bar I'd previously hidden).
I think this makes it far more visually informative now, but I'm still playing around with a dev version to consider how I can provide more informational cues to the user.

For now I'm going to take a small break to learn some general D3 skills. But my eventual plan
is to develop the project into a (common) example drugs graph, to which you can add/remove additional drugs, or even whole classes. With the option to build custom graphs from scatch.

For now you can also search through the entire drugs list, and use the informational side-bar.
