It's been a while since my last post, and since then I've been tinkering at new D3.js examples, and trying to make sense of the respective JS/CSS/HTML DOM components.
I've found experimented with a few different new environements, including the Google Chrome developer console, but the most intuitive I've found has actually been [Codepen](https://codepen.io/).

See the dendrograms below.
Or interact with them, [here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/bnfsections/#1) By pressing left or right.

I then created a collapsible version of my initial dendrogram, [here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/collapsibletree)
