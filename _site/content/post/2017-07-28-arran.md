Introduction
------------

This is an early project based on SIMD data that I'm using to try and
learn R. I've used the package
['ggplot2'](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) as part of
the Tidyverse to practice a set of skills I'm attempting to learn
through a combination of [DataCamp
courses](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r),
[RStudio 'Cheat Sheets'](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)
and [twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rstats?src=hash).

I thought Arran would make nice maps.

### Early progress

Initially I used map cordinates given by [Ordinance
Survey](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/opendatadownload/products.html)
to find the centre of any KA27 postcode on a map. (KA27 being the prefix
or 'postcode area' that denotes all Aran Island postcodes).

I then read the coordinates into sf with st\_as\_sf(), and plotted over
a shape file map of Arran; over the SIMD data zones, as well as the
section of coordinates contained in one data zone.

With the postcodes sorted, I then wanted to relate some other
information about these areas. I used
[SIMD](www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/SIMD) 'DataZone boundraries' and
plotted their ERSI Shapefiles using 'geom\_sf.' First the data zones
onto the island. Then I coloured/labelled the individual data zones.
Having worked that out, I wanted to show some health data about the
zones. I overlayed 'percentile' data about the areas for 2016.

Then after faffing about with individual shape files for every year,
(The data zone labels changed after 2012), I did the same for all the
SIMD data periods and used facet\_wrap to plot them all together.

Combining the postcode and SIMD data, I've summarised each of the zones
below.

As shown at the top, I've since overlaid this data onto interactive maps
using leaflet.

The overall aim of this project is to eventually create an easy template
by which a user with no prior programming knowledge can create
interactive graphs or static maps by overlaying some form of data
assigned to a postcode alone.

The reason I've chosen postcode is that it's a prevalent measurement
that can be integrated easily. Since I've already imported a list of
Arran Postcodes with coordinates, I can create markers for any given
address using one. For example, I had a list of each GP clinic on Arran.
If I put this information onto an excel chart, I can subsect the
original full postcode list by the clinic list, giving me a new list
with coordinates I can then plot as markers on a map with labels. This
means I can plot anything I'd like to see the geographical spread of and
using this method is the same amount of effort plotting the data for 10
markers as it would be for 100.

I can then overlay onto the map+markers any information I want. In my
first 2 maps I've shown SIMD DataZones (the units Scotland is subdivided
into for measurement purposes), but I could create overlays dividing up
the map by closest clinic for example (in 10/15/20 mile increments), or
distance to the ferry for hospital transport.

If I used OS postcode tiles I could even overlay some information (a
continuous/ variable matched to a colour palate) assigned to that
postcode. (Like the percentile data, but showing many smaller areas over
Arran).
