I made a few bits of progress.

[Here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/Interactions/)

I'm a bit lazy to make a 'how-to' tonight.

But in summary - I've linked my graph to the interaction messages, severities, evidence gradings taken from [bnf.nice.org.uk/interaction/.](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interaction/)
This reflects the new data being listed by the BNF.

The 'severe' interactions are highlighted on my sidebar.
(As well as severity totals as a whole.)

I've also made an on:hover comparison tool, for the drug selected and any other.

This graph was a significant step in terms of my learning with D3.js, and a good middle point for me to eventually integrate further graph customisations, such as built-from selected-drugs graphs, or a search bar for additional drugs to add on to the baseline (top 100 most commonly prescribed drugs).
And eventually, a properly-tensionable class hierachy.

As I learn more, I'll to customise this around features that benefit the interpretation/learning of health professionals, in a way it's not yet currently.
