I decided it might be useful to see the interaction information as plain text. 
Whereas the graph demonstrates the interactions which exist between drugs, as well as conveying the absence of interactions, this can be used as a checklist of warnings in a given drug selection.

I may add more detail later, such as evidence/severity, and colour coding on severe interactions. But for now it's a list-view of all the interactions known.

You can see the dev version [here.](https://fergustaylor.github.io/D3/bnf-interactionsdev/)
