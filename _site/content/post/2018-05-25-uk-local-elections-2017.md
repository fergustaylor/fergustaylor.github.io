Following a very interesting post I'd found on twitter by [Paul Campbell,](https://www.cultureofinsight.com/blog/2018/05/02/2018-04-08-multivariate-dot-density-maps-in-r-with-sf-ggplot2/) I was curious to try to recreate the plots involved myself.

Plotting a coloured point as a representation of 100 votes in each ward is interesting, it gives a surprising feel for the sense of party proportions in an area.
It doesn't give a sense of voter turnout vs population, but it does give a sense of scale to voting in areas.

I did wonder if the sense of geographic detail from each plot point, (the location within a ward is randomly generated), was misleading though.
For example, 100 plots below.

An interesting plot to try out. I've been enjoying the Guardian Visual and other election coverage recently, especially in the run-up to this years local elections, and it's given me a lot to think about.
A lot of my graphics lack polish, but getting the fundamentals right first is important too.
