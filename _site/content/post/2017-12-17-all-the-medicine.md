I've made a dendrogram based off the chemical lists provided by [NHS digital.](https://digital.nhs.uk/prescribing) (As part of their CCG Spending data).

These lists give a name, and lookup code for every medicine licensed in the UK based on BNF Sections.

E.g Adenosine (Chemical Sub: 0203020C0), i.e BNF > 2. 'Cardiovascular System' > 2.3 'Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs' > 2.3.2 'Drugs for Arrhythmias'

This 3-layer dendrogram is composed of every medicine (3292) listed on this look-up for potential NHS spending.
