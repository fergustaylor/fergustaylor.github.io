In my medical degree I was recently on placement at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Accident and Emergency department.
While there, I assisted with an audit into early pregnancy presentations to the department over a monthly period.

The point of this was to consider the presentation of patients to the department, and whether or not discharge criteria could be considered at triage in the form of a pro-forma, as is already the case in other Glasgow A and E departments.
