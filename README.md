I tend to use private repositories on Github when I'm working, ideally I'd like to make more public - especially when using public datasets, however I do at least try to post explanations of what I'm working on here.
The projects below show some examples of work I'm interested in at the moment.

## [**Arran**](https://fergustaylor.github.io/Arran)
An example exercise mapping SIMD health data onto [Arran](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=arran&oq=arran&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l3j69i65l2.2702j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
