**About Me:** My twitter bio says I'm a Glasgow medical student with interests in Global Surgery, C8H10N4O2, and skyscanner. That's fairly concise.

I've an interest in academic medicine, and have worked on a few projects as a student.
I'm interested now in learning how to do more data science using R. (Although I'm trying to learn Python, mostly for the Pi).

I tend to use private repositories on Github when I'm working on something, but ideally I'd like to make these more public - especially when using public datasets. So if there's something I can share, I do at least try to post explanations of what I'm working on here.
The projects below show some examples of work I'm interested in at the moment.
